The most interesting thing for me was how to create websites. So after the graduation I started my adventure with programming. I have completed the course for front end developers and spent a lot of time self-learning, so now I am ready to begin my career as Junior Front End WEB Developer, hardly working on myself and on the development of my company.</h3>
