            <h3>In university, programming always interested me, and I've always known that I want to work with Information Technologies. The most interesting thing for me was how to create websites. So after the graduation I started my adventure with programming. I have completed the course for front end developers and spent a lot of time self-learning. 
After several years of experience in this field, I can confidently say that I made the right choice. My favorite things in this area for me were solving complex problems, designing and developing looking to the future and, of course, communicating with colleagues who share my interest in this area. I hope that the same exciting projects and the same purposeful people are waiting for me!</h3>
